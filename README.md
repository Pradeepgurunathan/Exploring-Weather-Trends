# Exploring-Weather-Trends

In this Weather Trends project we will be analysing the local and global temperature data and also compare temperature trends where I reside to overall global tempature trends.
# Introduction

We all know that global temperature is increasing and according to NOAA 2019 Global Climate Summary, the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07°C (0.13°F) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 (0.18°C / 0.32°F) is more than twice as great.

This increaing in temperature is contributed by many factors such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation and also unscientific agriculture and farming.

In this report I have considered Dublin city temparature data and it has been compared to the global temperature data. After considering all the above factors for increase in global temperature,I have analysed and visualized the data to find the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and local temperature trends.

## Progress outline:
Extract the data :

• Downloading 2 data files from SQL database as CSV.

Create a line chart :

• Calculating the Moving Average (Rolling Average) to make it easier to observe the trends when it be shown in Charts.

• Visualizing the Data Using matplotlib

Make observations :

• I made observations the i saw related to the data "you can find more details on the Report file"

• I made a conclusion about the data.

more details are existed in the Report file.
